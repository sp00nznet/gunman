# Gunman Chronicles: The Full History

## Origins: From Quake Mod to Retail Game

Gunman Chronicles began life as **"Gunmanship 101"**, a humble Quake deathmatch mod created by
Herbert "Herb" Flower in the mid-1990s. Flower, working from Utah, assembled a team of modders
and founded **Rewolf Software** (his surname spelled backwards) in 1996.

The mod migrated engines twice:
1. **Quake** (original deathmatch mod)
2. **Quake II** (engine upgrade)
3. **GoldSrc / Half-Life** (final engine, licensed from Valve)

## The Big Break

At the **1999 Half-Life Mod Expo**, Gunman Chronicles was the standout. Sierra Entertainment
(Half-Life's publisher) approached Rewolf to turn it into a full retail product.

Valve Software directly supported the effort:
- Provided office space at Valve's Kirkland, WA offices
- Gave funding for development
- Assigned mapper **Jeff Lane** to help build levels
- Gabe Newell was personally involved (though Flower later said the relationship was strained)

## What Made It Special

For a 2000-era FPS, Gunman Chronicles was surprisingly innovative:

### Weapon Customization
Every weapon had adjustable parameters. The shotgun could switch between spread patterns.
The chemical gun let you tune its projectile behavior. This was years before weapon modding
became standard in FPS games.

### Vehicle Combat
A significant portion of the game featured drivable tanks through canyon environments --
something that was extremely rare in FPS games before Halo popularized it a year later.

### Setting
A bizarre but compelling sci-fi western aesthetic: space marines fighting dinosaurs and robots
on alien worlds, with a western frontier vibe. It shouldn't work but it absolutely does.

## Release: November 21, 2000

Gunman Chronicles holds the distinction of being the **first non-Valve standalone game** built
on the GoldSrc engine. It shipped as a full retail product through Sierra Entertainment.

**Reception:** Mixed reviews. Critics praised the weapon system and variety but found the
story generic and some levels unpolished. The game was considered good but overshadowed by
the flood of superior FPS titles in the 2000-2001 era.

**Sales:** Decent enough. Flower has said he "didn't get rich" from his share.

**Planned GameCube port:** Was in the works but never materialized.

## The Dissolution

Shortly after shipping, Rewolf Software dissolved. The team scattered:

- **Herb Flower** co-founded Mythyn Interactive with Paul Witte in 2001, then eventually
  left the games industry entirely. As of 2025, he runs **Goatogrammetry**, a photogrammetry
  texture business where pack goats carry his equipment through Utah's wilderness.

- **Stefan Baier, Renier Banninga, Adrian Banninga** moved to the Netherlands and co-founded
  **Streamline Studios** with Alexander L. Fernandez. Streamline became a successful game
  art outsourcing studio.

## The Rights Disaster

The ownership chain for Gunman Chronicles is a masterclass in IP hell:

1. **Rewolf Software** created it (dissolved)
2. **Sierra Entertainment** published it (absorbed into Vivendi)
3. **Valve Software** owns the engine and was directly involved (claims publishing rights)
4. **Vivendi** merged with **Activision** in 2008 to form **Activision Blizzard**
5. **Microsoft** acquired Activision Blizzard in 2023

The game was briefly shown in a Steam preview at **GDC 2002** but was never released on the platform.
As of 2026, Gunman Chronicles **cannot be legally purchased anywhere**. It is not on Steam, GOG,
or any digital storefront. Flower himself doesn't fully understand why.

## The Abandonware Era

With no legal purchase option, Gunman Chronicles has become a preservation concern:
- Available on **Internet Archive** and abandonware sites
- The game's prototypes and development materials have been archived
- A small but dedicated community keeps it alive through modding and compatibility patches
